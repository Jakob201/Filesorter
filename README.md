# Filesorter
Just a fun little project of mine.

I coded this a long time ago when i was just starting out, with Python.

Therefor beware, because it probably has loads of bugs.

## Anyway, heres what it does:
Like the Name tells you it sorts your files for you. 
1. When first startet it creates a download folder and a manual folder.
2. Everytime you put a file in said Folder it looks at the ending (PDF, docx, etc.)
3. When there already is a Folder, for example PDF for a Pdf file in the folder it moves the file. If there is no Folder for the file, it creates one.

## Extras

There are also is some kind of menu, where you can select your options, like start, stop, help.

You can put the sorter in your autostart folder, where it starts automatically when you start your pc, instructions you can find in the menu.

## Conclusion
Like I said i coded this a long time ago, so dont rely on this thing XD

I am just uploading this because I want it in my repositorys
